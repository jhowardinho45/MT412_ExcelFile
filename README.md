# Video Game Sales Data
**Introduction and Explanation**

For this project, I wanted to showcase some of my Excel skills through my passion for video games. I downloaded a basic dataset off of Kaggle and started the work from there.

The dataset dealt with the most popular/most sold games from the 1980s all the way up until 2020.

In this short project, I used basic formulas to get a basic idea or some of the figures I was wondering about. As well as this, I implemented both Vlookup functions and Pivot Tables, which initially I always found the most difficult in using Excel.

Finally, I added some basic visualisations to showcase some of the data I found, for a simple yet informative project on Video Games.
