# Reviewing Students Data - Basic SQL Functions

## Overview 

For my Excel project, I decided to look at a video games dataset that dealt with the most popular/most sold games from the 1980s all the way up until 2020. In this short project, I used basic formulas to get a basic idea or some of the figures I was wondering about. As well as this, I implemented both Vlookup functions and Pivot Tables, which initially I always found the most difficult in using Excel. Finally, I added some basic visuals. I got this dataset from Kaggle '(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tayyarhussain/best-selling-video-games-of-all-time)'.
